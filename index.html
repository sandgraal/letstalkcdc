            Your analytics team needs data in real-time. Your business partners
            want to build dashboards, set up alerts, and tailor customer
            experiences on the fly. Change Data Capture (CDC) seems like the
            magic answer, but most implementations fail to deliver on the
            promise. This series is about how to get it right.

        <h2>The Core Problem</h2>
        <p>
          We've advanced from overnight batch jobs to log-based CDC, which
          promises real-time data with no load on source systems. Yet, reality
          frequently doesn’t measure up. The challenge isn't capturing an event;
          it's building a system that is scalable, reliable, fault-tolerant, and
          observable under pressure.
        </p>

        <h2>What We'll Uncover</h2>
