# Implementation Review Summary
**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Branch:** `work`

---

## Snapshot
- **Health:** 8.0/10 – core flows stable; operational gaps remain.
- **Highlights:** Zero-dependency static shell, fresh simulator/comparator bundles referenced; feature flag loader resilient to bad input.
- **Gaps:** Playwright E2E blocked by missing browsers; feature flag defaults drift from docs (`ff_walkthrough`, `ff_trigger_mode` absent from `index.html`); rollout docs referenced a past v1.0 release.

---

## Current Test Signal
- ✅ Unit: 18 files / 88 tests passing (`npm run test:unit`).
- ✅ Property tests: 24 generated scenarios passing (`npm run test:sim`).
- ⚠️ E2E: 7 specs failed immediately because Playwright browsers are not installed; rerun after `npx playwright install`.

---

## Top Priorities
1. **Unblock Playwright runs** – install/cache browsers in CI and document local setup; rerun all 7 specs and attach traces.
2. **Align feature flag defaults** – decide on `ff_walkthrough` + `ff_trigger_mode` defaults, update `index.html` and docs together, and add a shared manifest to avoid drift.
3. **Bundle freshness + perf budget** – add a guard that generated assets match sources before publishing `index.html`, and capture baseline load metrics for the reverted shell.

---

## Notable Findings
- UI shell lazy-load guarded by `comparator_v2` keeps the base playground fast.
- Status/docs overstated readiness (claimed v1.0 + all tests green); now corrected to reflect the 0.1.0 snapshot and current test signal.
- Existing contributor guides remain valid; add a short E2E setup note to avoid repeated browser-missing failures.

---

## Next Steps
- Track execution in `docs/ACTION_PLAN.md` (updated in this pass).
- Keep README “Current Status” in sync with the latest review to avoid signaling a level of readiness we have not yet re-validated.
