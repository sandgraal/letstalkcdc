# Development Playbook

This playbook documents the day-to-day workflow we follow once you are set up locally. Pair it with `docs/dev-onboarding.md` (tool installation) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (code of conduct, Hacktoberfest details).

## Branching Strategy
- Create **feature branches off `main`** for all work. Never commit directly to `main`.
- Name branches descriptively: `feature/harness-history`, `bugfix/playwright-timeout`, `docs/update-readme`.
- Keep branches focused on a single issue / change set. Open separate branches when work is unrelated.
- Rebase or merge the latest `main` before opening a PR to reduce conflicts.

## Issue-First Workflow
1. Pick an open GitHub issue (labels `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `hacktoberfest`, etc.) or open a new issue to discuss scope before coding.
2. Reference the issue in your branch/PR using `Fixes #123` so it auto-closes when merged.

## Running Tests Locally

### Unit and Property Tests
Unit tests and property-based simulator tests don't require any special setup:
```bash
npm run test:unit      # Vitest unit suite (88 tests)
npm run test:sim       # Property-based CDC scenario tests
```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
E2E tests require Playwright browsers to be installed. **First-time setup:**
```bash
npm run setup:e2e
```

This installs Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers along with system dependencies. On macOS, you may need to allow the installation in System Preferences if prompted.

To verify the browsers are available (and surface next steps if they are not), run the local doctor:
```bash
npm run doctor:e2e
```

**Running E2E tests:**
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

**Common issues:**
- **"Executable doesn't exist"**: Run `npx playwright install --with-deps` again
- **"Browser launch failed"**: Check that system dependencies are installed (Playwright will guide you)
- **Tests timeout**: Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts` if running on slower hardware
- **Trace artifacts**: Failed tests generate traces in `test-results/`; use `npx playwright show-trace <trace.zip>` to debug

**CI note**: GitHub Actions workflows should run `npx playwright install --with-deps` before `npm run test:e2e` to ensure browsers are available.

## Performance Measurement

The playground maintains performance budgets for Core Web Vitals and transfer sizes. Before making changes that could affect performance:

1. **Measure baseline** using Chrome DevTools Lighthouse:
   - Open DevTools → Lighthouse tab
   - Run Performance audit
   - Note LCP, TTI, FCP, and transfer sizes

2. **Check budgets** against targets in [`docs/performance-budgets.md`](./performance-budgets.md):
   - LCP < 3.0s
   - TTI < 5.0s
   - Total initial load < 450 KB (gzipped)

3. **Re-measure after changes** to ensure no regressions

See [`docs/performance-budgets.md`](./performance-budgets.md) for detailed measurement methods and baseline metrics.

## Expectations Before Opening a Pull Request
- **Tests**: run the quick suite locally. At minimum:
  ```bash
  npm run lint:flags
  npm run lint:scenarios
  npm run test:unit
  npm run test:e2e
  ```
  If you have Docker available, run the harness smoke as well (`npm run ci:harness`).
- **Security**: if you've modified dependencies, run a security audit:
  ```bash
  npm run audit:prod  # Check production dependencies only
  ```
  CI will also run this check automatically, but catching issues locally saves time.
- **Builds**: only regenerate generated bundles when the change requires it (see README “Deploy” sections).
- **Docs**: update or create documentation for any new behaviour. Examples: README, `docs/harness-guide.md`, `docs/harness-history.md`.
- **Changelog/Notes**: add or update release notes (`docs/enablement/release-notes.md`) when the change is user-facing.

## Pull Request Checklist
- [ ] Branch created from `main` with a descriptive name.
- [ ] Issue linked in the PR description.
- [ ] Summary explains the problem, solution, tests, and any follow-up work.
- [ ] Screenshots or recordings included for UI changes.
- [ ] All required scripts/tests completed and results shared in the PR body.
- [ ] No unrelated files or generated artifacts included.

## After Merge
- Delete the feature branch (local + remote) once the PR is merged.
- If the change affects nightly harness or documentation, ensure corresponding GitHub issues are closed.

## Need Help?
Use the issue thread or the PR conversation to ask questions. We would rather clarify up front than send you back for large revisions.
