# Appwrite Login + Progress Persistence Integration

This adds persistent learning progress and authentication across devices to the CDC Playground.

## Setup

1. **Appwrite**

   - Create database `main`.
   - Import `appwrite.collections.json`.
   - Generate an API key with DB read/write.
   - Note your `APPWRITE_PROJECT`, `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`, and key.

2. **Netlify & Local Development**
   Define the Appwrite environment variables both in Netlify and in any local `.env` file used by `netlify dev`. Only the non-secret values are exposed to the browser‚Äî`APPWRITE_API_KEY` must remain server-side.

   | Variable | Scope | Notes |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` | Client & Functions | Forwarded to the browser as `window.APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`. |
   | `APPWRITE_PROJECT` | Client & Functions | Forwarded to the browser as `window.APPWRITE_PROJECT`. |
   | `APPWRITE_DB_ID` | Client & Functions | Forwarded to the browser as `window.APPWRITE_DB_ID`. |
   | `COL_PROGRESS_ID` | Client & Functions | Forwarded to the browser as `window.COL_PROGRESS_ID`. |
   | `COL_EVENTS_ID` | Client & Functions | Forwarded to the browser as `window.COL_EVENTS_ID`. |
   | `APPWRITE_API_KEY` | **Functions only** | Consumed by Netlify functions; never render this in templates or client bundles. |

   Populate those variables with the IDs that match your Appwrite project. Netlify deploy contexts inherit the same keys, so set them in the ‚ÄúSite settings ‚Üí Environment variables‚Äù UI or via `netlify env:set`.

3. **Eleventy**

- Include `/scripts/progress.js` in all journey layouts.
- Eleventy reads the Appwrite variables via `src/_data/appwrite.cjs` and injects the non-secret values as `window.APPWRITE_*` and `window.COL_*` globals. No additional build wiring is required.
- Call:
  ```js
  CDCProgress.onStepChange({ journeySlug, step, percent, state });
  ```
  whenever a user moves to a new step.

4. **GitHub OAuth provider in Appwrite**

   In the Appwrite Console ‚Üí **Authentication ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí GitHub**:

   1. Supply the GitHub OAuth App Client ID and Client Secret.
   2. Add the following redirect URLs (adjust the domain to match production and previews):
      - `http://localhost:8888/?auth=success`
      - `http://localhost:8888/?auth=failed`
      - `https://<your-production-domain>/?auth=success`
      - `https://<your-production-domain>/?auth=failed`
      - Include any additional Netlify preview domains that should be allowed.
      - **Important:** the widget appends `?auth=‚Ä¶` to the *current page URL*, so Appwrite will receive the full path (e.g., `/journey/foo?auth=success`). Either whitelist every path your journeys use (Appwrite accepts wildcards like `https://<domain>/*`) or update the site code to redirect to a fixed callback path before initiating OAuth.
   3. Save and enable the provider.

   The progress widget constructs success/failure URLs by appending `?auth=success` or `?auth=failed` to the current page location, so each origin that serves the site must be explicitly whitelisted.

5. **Testing**

- Run locally with `netlify dev`.
- Confirm:
  - Anonymous session ‚Üí creates progress doc.
  - OAuth login ‚Üí runs migration via `migrateUser.js`.
  - Resume toast appears when returning to a journey.

  For local testing, create a `.env` file that mirrors the Netlify environment variables above. Start the dev server with `netlify dev` so that the serverless functions receive the same configuration.

6. **Deploy**

- Commit to `feature/appwrite-progress-login`.
- Push and verify deploy preview.
- Merge to `main` once verified.

Ensure Eleventy wiring:

Journey templates import /scripts/progress.js.

Netlify functions rely on the built-in Fetch API and no longer require the `node-appwrite` SDK dependency.

Buttons call CDCProgress.signInWithOAuth("github") and CDCProgress.signOut().

The ‚ÄúResume‚Äù toast works with CDCProgress.offerResume().

Validate deployment:

Test on local (netlify dev) and remote (preview).

Confirm both anonymous and authenticated users persist progress.
