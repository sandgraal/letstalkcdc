    <main id="main"><h1>The Modern CDC Toolkit: A Platform Comparison</h1>
      <article class="prose">
        <p>
          The market for Change Data Capture tools has matured significantly,
          offering a range of solutions that cater to different needs. Choosing
          the right tool involves balancing control, cost, and convenience.
        </p>

        <h2 id="open-source">Open-Source Champions: Power and Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
          Open-source tools are favored by organizations with strong in-house
          data engineering capabilities that require deep customization and want
          to avoid vendor lock-in.
        </p>
        <h3>Debezium</h3>
        <p>
          Debezium has emerged as the de facto open-source standard for
          log-based CDC. It is a distributed platform of connectors that runs on
          the Apache Kafka Connect framework, providing high-performance,
          low-latency connectors for a wide range of popular databases.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Free to use (Apache 2.0 license), highly
            flexible, robust feature set, and backed by a large community.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> The primary challenge is operational
            complexity. It requires users to deploy, manage, scale, and monitor
            the underlying infrastructure, including Kafka and Kafka Connect,
            which requires significant technical expertise.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Airbyte (OSS core + Cloud)</h3>
        <p>
          Airbyte provides a large connector catalog (including CDC connectors)
          with an OSS core and a hosted “Cloud” offering. CDC depth varies by
          source; many pipelines are log-based, others are polling.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Broad connector coverage; easy to get
            started; active ecosystem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Operational polish and CDC fidelity depend on
            the specific connector; long-running streaming jobs may need tuning.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Maxwell’s Daemon (MySQL)</h3>
        <p>
          A lightweight MySQL binlog tailer that emits JSON change events to
          Kafka/Kinesis. Simpler than Debezium but focused on MySQL only.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Small footprint, easy to run for MySQL-only
            stacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Narrow scope; fewer enterprise features
            (schema registry integration, snapshots, etc.).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="managed-cloud">
          Fully Managed Cloud Services: Simplicity and Integration
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cloud providers offer managed CDC services that abstract away the
          complexity of infrastructure management, allowing teams to set up data
          pipelines quickly.
        </p>
        <h3>AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)</h3>
        <p>
          AWS DMS is a fully managed service that supports a wide variety of
          migrations and replications. It can capture changes from sources like
          Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server and deliver them to targets across
          the AWS ecosystem, such as Amazon S3 and Redshift.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Its main advantages are simplicity and deep
            integration with the AWS ecosystem. It has a pay-as-you-go pricing
            model and eliminates the need for users to manage any underlying
            servers or software.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Performance can be variable, and it is
            primarily designed for use within the AWS ecosystem, which can lead
            to vendor lock-in. It can also have limitations regarding the
            capture of certain database features or DDL changes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Google Cloud Datastream</h3>
        <p>
          Serverless, log-based CDC into Google Cloud (BigQuery, Cloud SQL,
          GCS). Integrates with Dataflow templates for transformations and
          Warehouse MERGE patterns.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Low-ops, serverless scale; smooth handoff to
            BigQuery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Best inside GCP; feature gaps for certain
            sources/DDL.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Azure (ADF/Synapse) with CDC</h3>
        <p>
          Azure Data Factory / Synapse pipelines support change capture for SQL
          Server/Azure SQL and integration with Event Hubs & Data Lake for
          downstream processing.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Native Azure integration; quick path to
            Synapse/Lake.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Mixed CDC depth across sources; tuning needed
            for low-latency needs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Confluent Cloud (Managed Connect + Debezium)</h3>
        <p>
          Managed Kafka Connect with official Debezium-based source connectors
          and schema registry. Reduces the ops burden of running Connect while
          keeping the open-source connector model.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Paved-road operations (scaling, monitoring,
            upgrades) for Connect/Registry.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Still requires Kafka mental model; priced as
            a managed platform.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="commercial">
          Commercial Enterprise Platforms: Support and Scale
        </h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Source coverage &amp; method:</strong> true log-based vs
            polling; snapshot modes (initial, incremental, resume).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DDL behavior:</strong> adds/renames/drops; online schema
            change support; registry compatibility modes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Delivery semantics:</strong> ALO by default; EOS
            <em>scope</em> (Kafka-only transactions vs idempotent sinks for
            external warehouses).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exactly-once at the sink:</strong> MERGE/UPSERT patterns,
            staging+MERGE, dedupe tables.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ops &amp; observability:</strong> lag/backlog metrics, DLQs,
            replay/rewind, upgrade path.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multi-tenancy &amp; cost:</strong> topic/partition math,
            RF/retention, egress/storage pricing, chargeback/quota features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security &amp; governance:</strong> PII masking, field-level

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="gotchas">Common gotchas (agnostic to vendor)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Log retention bloat:</strong> paused/broken connectors can
            block WAL/binlog/T-log cleanup—alert on backlog age.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schema drift:</strong> without a registry + policies,
            producers break consumers; enforce compatibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Polling CDC deletions:</strong> hard deletes aren’t
            visible—add soft-delete markers or change tables.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Global ordering myths:</strong> CDC preserves per-key order,
            not cross-entity total order.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Warehouse costs:</strong> too-frequent small MERGEs are
            expensive—batch micro-windows without violating freshness SLOs.
