<div class="content">
  <p>Change Data Capture (CDC) has long been treated as plumbing—low-level extraction with little alignment to software delivery.</p>
  <p>In this talk, we explore what happens when <strong>CDC joins the CI/CD lifecycle</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Version-controlled configurations for agents and connectors</li>
    <li>Stream-aware automated testing</li>
    <li>Blue-green promotion for data pipelines</li>
    <li>GitHub Actions + Matillion orchestration examples</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The goal: <strong>streaming pipelines as deployable artifacts</strong>. By the end, you’ll see how DevOps thinking closes the loop between change, delivery, and data integrity.</p>
