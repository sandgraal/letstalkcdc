      <h1>The Modern CDC Toolkit: A Platform Comparison</h1>
      <article class="prose">
        <p>
          The market for Change Data Capture tools has matured significantly,
          offering a range of solutions that cater to different needs. Choosing
          the right tool involves balancing control, cost, and convenience.
        </p>

        <h2 id="open-source">Open-Source Champions: Power and Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
          Open-source tools are favored by organizations with strong in-house
          data engineering capabilities that require deep customization and want
          to avoid vendor lock-in.
        </p>
        <h3>Debezium</h3>
        <p>
          Debezium has emerged as the de facto open-source standard for
          log-based CDC. It is a distributed platform of connectors that runs on
          the Apache Kafka Connect framework, providing high-performance,
          low-latency connectors for a wide range of popular databases.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Free to use (Apache 2.0 license), highly
            flexible, robust feature set, and backed by a large community.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> The primary challenge is operational
            complexity. It requires users to deploy, manage, scale, and monitor
            the underlying infrastructure, including Kafka and Kafka Connect,
            which requires significant technical expertise.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="managed-cloud">
          Fully Managed Cloud Services: Simplicity and Integration
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cloud providers offer managed CDC services that abstract away the
          complexity of infrastructure management, allowing teams to set up data
          pipelines quickly.
        </p>
        <h3>AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)</h3>
        <p>
          AWS DMS is a fully managed service that supports a wide variety of
          migrations and replications. It can capture changes from sources like
          Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server and deliver them to targets across
          the AWS ecosystem, such as Amazon S3 and Redshift.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Its main advantages are simplicity and deep
            integration with the AWS ecosystem. It has a pay-as-you-go pricing
            model and eliminates the need for users to manage any underlying
            servers or software.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Performance can be variable, and it is
            primarily designed for use within the AWS ecosystem, which can lead
            to vendor lock-in. It can also have limitations regarding the
            capture of certain database features or DDL changes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="commercial">
          Commercial Enterprise Platforms: Support and Scale
        </h2>
        <p>
          A number of commercial vendors offer polished, enterprise-grade CDC
          platforms that provide end-to-end solutions with dedicated support and
          guaranteed SLAs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Oracle GoldenGate:</strong> A long-standing leader in data
            replication, known for high performance and reliability, especially
            in Oracle environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fivetran:</strong> A modern, cloud-native ELT platform
            celebrated for its ease of use and a massive library of pre-built
            connectors. Its consumption-based pricing can become costly at high
            volumes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Striim:</strong> A unified platform that combines CDC with
            real-time, in-flight stream processing and analytics, focused on
            powering operational use cases that demand sub-second latency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Qlik Replicate (formerly Attunity):</strong> An
            enterprise-grade solution known for its broad platform support and
            an intuitive graphical user interface that simplifies replication
            tasks.
          </li>
